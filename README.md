## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While participating in this challenge, I deepened my knowledge in html and css, for the first time laying out a page on the concept of "mobile-first" and solved a simple task of processing a button click using javascript 

### Continued development

I will use the "BEM" methodology when writing classes and try to use the preprocessor SASS.

### Useful resources

- [fls.guru/](https://fls.guru/) - I got a lot of information from this guy's blog. The explanation on working with flexbox and pseudo-elements was very helpful.
